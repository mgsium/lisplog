(Initial Entry)

Targets:
[/] Set up Emacs & SLIME env.
[/] Initialize GitHub Repository.

[/] Lisp History
[/] Basic Lisp Syntax and Language Components
Notes:
Lisp Machine: A (computer) machine designed to run Lisp natively from the bottom up, first pioneered at MIT.

GNU -> GNU is not Unix
SLIME -> Superior Lisp Interaction Mode for Emacs
SBCL -> Steel Bank Common Lisp

- Lisp uses Prefix/Polish/≈Åukasiewicz notation.
- SBCL derives from CMUCL (Carnegie Mellon University Common Lisp)
- CLisp derives from John McCarthy's origial 1956-borne Lisp.
  - McCarthy was an AI researcher.
  - Common Lisp the Language (CLtL), Guy Steele was published in 1984.
  - ANSI published another CLisp standard in 1996.
- The Basic Unit of Lisp Programs are S-Expressions
  - "Atoms" are indivisble S-expressions.
- Emacs is built on a C core, but is extensible in Lisp.

Questions from today:
What is Aspect Oriented Programming (AOP)?
Difference between Lexical vs Dynamic Variables Bindings?
