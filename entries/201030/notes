201030 Lisp Log Entry

Targets:
[/] Learn about Fixed Recursion in Lisp
[/] Learn about Variable Recursion in Lisp

Notes:
- LOOP and ITER are both notable macros used for iteration
  - LOOP is part of the clisp standard library, but ITER is not.
- DOLIST and DOTIMES allow for the binding of a single iteration variable at one time, whereas DO allows for multiple variable bindings.
