- CLisp supports "lexical" and "dynamic" variables.
- CLisp has both strongly and dynamically typed aspects, but is generally conisdered strong typed on the whole.
- LET introduces variables within a local scope
- LET* is similar to LET, but allows initial variable forms to refer to variables in the list.
- All constants are global and are defined with DEFCONSTANT
- LAMBDA defines anonymous functions, for use as predicates, for example.
